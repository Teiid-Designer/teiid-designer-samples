### More cli examples

On this page we will provide a few more example script files and VDB files that you can try.  They go a bit further in complexity than the previous simple examples.  We will continue to add more examples to this page as they are developed.

Remember, you can use __tab completion__ to see the available commands and sub-command options, or use __help__ to see command details.


### Requirements

* Install VDB Builder cli - refer to the [Installation Instructions](install-cli.md) for details


### Dynamic VDBs

Try importing these dynamic VDBs, which are a bit more complex than the previous examples.

[example1-vdb.xml](files/example1-vdb.xml)
[BQTExample-vdb.xml](files/BQTExample-vdb.xml)


### Command files

The following command files provide more examples of scripting VDB creation.

[commandExample1.txt](files/commandExample1.txt)
[commandExample2.txt](files/commandExample2.txt)
