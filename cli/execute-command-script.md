### Execute a command file

This sample shows how to use the VDB Builder cli to execute a previously saved session command file.  You can create or edit existing command files to fully script the construction of your VDBs!  Use this sample as a starting point for working with your own VDBS.

Remember, you can use __tab completion__ to see the available commands and sub-command options, or use __help__ to see command details.


### Requirements

* Install VDB Builder cli - refer to the [Installation Instructions](install-cli.md) for details
